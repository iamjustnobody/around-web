NOTE! - class components are used back to the time this project was created & not intend to convert into functional components and hooks since I deleted the backend instance completely on GCP to save money. For examples of using functional components, hooks, context, (or forwardRef), please check out chat room web app github.com/iamjustnobody/chatchat , or my own React portfolio web github.com/iamjustnobody/my-react-portfolio

Using React @front-end.

Bank-end code using Golang on GCP is not included here

web features: can post photos & video; can show nearby images & videos on google-map; facial detection
